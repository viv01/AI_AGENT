## AI AGENT IN LANGGRAPH

What is an 'AI conversation' and what does an 'AI Agent conversation' look like (Reality vs Hype)

A demo showing an AI agent i have created for planning my travel around my meeting calendar. (watch at 1.25 x speed on youtube)

1. A LangGraph AI agent (text based conversation) which can plan a travel/dining out schedule based on my meeting calendar (google calendar)
	- TOOL CALLING
		- calling google calendar (through an MCP server) to get my meeting information for next week
		- calling google maps to calculate distance and travel times
		- using a web search tool to get phone numbers of places
	- HUMAN IN THE LOOP
		- take a manual input and improve results of the AI
	- PERSISTENT MEMORY 
		- A DATABASE to permanently store user preferences (PostgreSQL DB used)
	- calling an MCP SERVER that can authorize with google calendar and get my meeting details
